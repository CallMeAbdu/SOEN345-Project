# Cloud-Based Ticket Reservation Application

The Cloud-Based Ticket Reservation Application is a ticket booking system developed for SOEN 345. It allows users to browse events such as movies, concerts, travel, and sports, reserve tickets, cancel bookings, and receive digital confirmations via email or SMS.

The system supports both customers and event administrators. Customers can search and filter events, while administrators can manage the events by adding, editing, or cancelling them.

Built in Java and designed for cloud deployment, the application supports concurrent users, prevents overbooking, and provides a simple and user-friendly experience.
